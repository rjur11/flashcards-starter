# FlashCards!

## Overview

A simple flashcard type game that allows a user to play through a deck of flashcards in their command line (terminal). Once the game begins, a user is fed one question at a time, each with 3 answers to choose from. A user can cycle through answers with up/down arrow keys or enter the corresponding number (1-3) and hitting enter. The game will notify if the user answered correctly, and will continue through the deck of cards until the end of the flashcard deck. At the end of the game, the user will be given a final score!
